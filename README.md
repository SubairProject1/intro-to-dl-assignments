#Introduction to Deep Learning – Programming Assignments

This repository contains the eight programming exercises I completed independently for the course Introduction to Deep Learning.
All practical work was implemented in Python using PyTorch, focusing on understanding and applying deep learning methods.

The course covers the theoretical foundations of deep learning as well as practical model development across different neural network architectures.
